//Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

const magician=["sarim","huzaifa","moosa","ahmed","ali"];
function show_magicians(magician){
    mag_length=magician.length;
    for(var i=0;i<mag_length;i++){
        console.log(magician[i]);
    }
}
function make_great(magician){

    for(var i=0;i<magician.length;i++){
        console.log(`${magician[i]} the Great`);
    }
}
console.log("make_great function: ")
make_great(magician);
console.log("show_magicians function: ")
show_magicians(magician);
